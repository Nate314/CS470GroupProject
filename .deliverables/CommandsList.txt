Most of the interaction with our database from the "front end" will be
done through sending messages on discord to communicate with the bot.
Below is a list of different commands that can be used with the bot:

r?daily
every day you can run this command to recieve 200 credits once every 24 hours
the bot will check who sent this message and add 200 credits to that user in the
DiscordUsers table if that user hasn't sent r?daily in the last 24 hours

r?credits
running this command tells the bot to query the DB and check for how many
credits the sender of the message has

r?manual
this command will cause the bot to query the DB for a list of commands
and command descriptions and then the bot will send those back to the channel
where the r?manual command was sent from

r?transfer <number> <@user>
this command is used to transfer <number> amount of currency to <@user>

r?raffle start <number> <name>
starts a raffle with <number> amount of currency with the name <name>

including the amount of currency currently in this raffle, the number
of participants in this raffle, and the end date

r?raffle end <name>
